# sudoku_scraper_and_solver

Sudoku scraper and solver app. Final project @ developers-lab.me. This is the application that scrapes the sudoku puzzle from the web and makes the matrix out of it. You can solve the scraped puzzle with an user interface made with tkinter in python. User can make input with the keyboard or with the number buttons on the interface. When user completes the puzzle the application asks user to write his/her name, and the solution is saved in the db folder like a plain text file. If the user has difficulty to solve the puzzle he/she can click on the "solve" button and automatic solution will be written in the db folder like a plain text file.
